# Sparkify

## Overview
Sparkify is a music streaming service just as Spotify and Pandora. The data provided is the user log of the service, having demographic info, user activities, 
timestamps and etc. We try to analyze the log and build a model to identify customers who are highly likely to quit using our service, and thus, 
send marketing offers to them to prevent them from churning.

 - Spark (Java and Scala are requirements for Spark)
